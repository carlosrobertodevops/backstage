  # Should be the same as backend.baseUrl when using the `app-backend` plugin.
  baseUrl: http://localhost:7007

backend:
  # Note that the baseUrl should be the URL that the browser and other clients
  # should use when communicating with the backend, i.e. it needs to be
  # reachable not just from within the backend host, but from all of your
  # callers. When its value is "http://localhost:7007", it's strictly private
  # and can't be reached by others.

    allow:
    - host: 'gist.githubusercontent.com'
    - host: 'github.com'
  baseUrl: http://localhost:7007
  # The listener can also be expressed as a single <host>:<port> string. In this case we bind to
  # all interfaces, the most permissive setting. The right value depends on your specific deployment.

  ### Example for how to add a proxy endpoint for the frontend.
  ### A typical reason to do this is to handle HTTPS and CORS for internal services.
